## Elixir Academy

Elixir Academy was created for children between block coding like Scratch and real coding languages like JS and Python. It's easy to use and good for beginners. It uses Firebase for a secure login and Firebase for progress storage. The certificates are made with certifier.io(but CORS is currently stopping it, so its a WIP). The main site is in Next.js with typescript and the backend is node.js and python for the interpreter.
