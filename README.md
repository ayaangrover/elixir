## Elixir Academy

# About
Elixir Academy is a website designed for kids who are ready to expand beyond block-based coding (like Scratch) and start learning real programming languages like JavaScript and Python. Itâ€™s simple to use, beginner-friendly, and helps make the transition to text-based coding smoother. In other words, it's great for anyone and everyone!

# The tech used
Next.js w/ typescrpt was used for the website. The backend was made in node.js with the interpreter made in python. Firebase is used for login and progress storage.

# Coming soon
Fixing the certificate generator - I have to fix a CORS issue.
A larger curriculum - This is just more lessons and practices for each part(you can create a PR with more lessons if you want to help!)
More interpreter features - Since I'm trying to bridge the gap between block coding and python/js, I need to make it really similar and yet easy, so that'll take a while(again, feel free to contribute!)

# How to contribute
Fork the repo, add changes, and make a PR - it's that simple!
